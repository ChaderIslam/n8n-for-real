✅ 1. Free Proxy Lists (For Testing Only)
These are public, often unreliable and may be slow or already blacklisted:

https://free-proxy-list.net

https://www.sslproxies.org

https://proxylist.geonode.com

https://spys.one/en/

https://hidemy.name/en/proxy-list/

https://proxyscrape.com/free-proxy-list

Each site provides:

IP Address

Port

Protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4/5)

Sometimes country or anonymity level

⚠️ Use free proxies for light or non-critical use only — not for production bots.

✅ 2. Paid Proxy Services (Reliable)
If you're serious or need scale/consistency, use paid options:
